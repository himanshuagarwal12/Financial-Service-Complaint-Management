Bottom  line  worst  brokerage  banking  relationship  ever  experienced.  Considering  always  attempted  try  build  solid  relationship  company  deal  with,  case,  Scottrade,  especially  end,  highly  disruptive  life  financially.  day  ago,  company  closed  account  without  warning,  claiming  using  account  business  purchases  company  policy  so.  Sure,  much  activity  account.  's  say  making  purchases  personal  reasons?!  further,  heck  tells  spend  money?!  work  hard  money  earn  trade,  carries  heavy  weight  everyday  life.  Scottrade  account  {$60000.00}  balance,  created  strong  hindrance  point  on.  Bill  payments  delayed,  simple  everyday  operations  placed  hold.  Never  life  receive  low  disregard  terrible  treatment  loyal  customer.  disgust  company  operations,  wanted  speak  supervisor  this,  transferred  local  branch  instead  deal  middle  associate.  would  love  point  n't  illegal  transactions  made,  negative  balances  occurred,  tainted  disrespectful  conversation  acknowledgment  toward  staff.  honestly  ca  n't  think  anything  deserve  type  treatment.  made  purchases  completed  needed  transactions  needed  to.  used  bank  account  way  bank  account  used  for.  Overall,  company  much  better  is.  would  n't  return  within  ranks,  even  paid  $  so.
experiences  left  truly  wondering  Scottrade  n't  investigated  SEC.  's  strange  one  day  funds  scheduled  settled,  day  arrives  money  n't  there.  local  store  representative  blamed  "  computer  error  ''  called  another  representative  offered  free  trades  offset  inability  access  {$38000.00}  trading.  explanation  proffered,  despite  correspondence  promise  would  review  matter.  Another  suspicious  occurrence  involves  Scottrade  restricting  account  possibly  limiting  access  cash  days  normal  2  3  days  takes  trades  "  settle  ''  store  representative  claimed  computer  accused  making  "  free  ride.

But,  store  clerk  would  n't  accept  explanation  account  restricted  anyway.  Remember,  computer  store  clerk  blamed  failing  fund  account  couple  weeks  prior.  So,  'm  going  reduce  trading  activities  Scottrade  abundance  caution,  likely  take  grievance  SEC  formal  complaint.  urge  others  careful  look  activities  like  've  described.  n't  forget  often  matters  dealing  brokerage  accounts  require  arbitration  instead  day  court.
